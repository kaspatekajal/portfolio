Hello there! 

Welcome to my page on github. I am a lifelong learner with over 20 years of experience in transforming enterprise business solutions using various Business Orchastration and Automation Technologies. I am at my best when I am a learning something new or imagining what's next! I love dreaming ways technology can solve just about any problem - whether it's helping a top UK bank enhance fraud detection or figuering out the perfect weekend adventure with my 5-year old. 


Here's my LinkedIn and it is not that jazzy ;)

Alright, so, one fine day I decided to go through Masters Program for **AI & ML** and here I am, with the list of my _academic_ projects. To tell you the truth I cannot wait to work on my masters thesis and the industry projects once the program is finished in December 2025. Be back here then and will have my masters dissertation listed here. 

## Projects (Feb 2024 - Mar 2025) 

You will find most recent projects at the top - newest first!

### Search System for Fashion Company’s Product Catalogue 
*  Developed a search system for a fashion company's product catalogue, enabling users to search for products and receive responses in natural language
*  Used frameworks like LangChain to build a generative search system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### Q&A Help System for Insurance Documents using RAG
*  Implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with OpenAI
*  Created an Embedding Layer using the vector database ChromaDB
*  Developed a Search Layer with cache and re-ranker functionalities
*  Built a Generative Layer to produce final answers

### Custom ChatBot (HolidayClub Advisor for Parent) using LLM
*  Conceptualized and developed a custom chatbot project
*  Created sample data and built the chatbot
*  Utilized the Function Calling feature from OpenAI to convert chat messages into API calls

### Online shopping assistant ChatBot using LLMs
*  Developed a chatbot using OpenAI APIs
*  Implemented Few-shot Prompting and Chain-of-Thought Prompting to enhance the chatbot's capabilities
*  Integrated a Moderation API to detect and respond to unsafe queries and prompt injections

### Classify customer complaints based on products and services using Natural Language Processing
*  Lemmatized and extracted POS tags, visualizing results with a word cloud
*  Identified top unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, arranging them by frequency to understand various topics in the complaints
*  Extracted features using the TF-IDF vectorize
*  Created and evaluated various supervised models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Multinomial Naïve Bayes) for topic modelling

### Gesture recognition project using CNN-RNN stack
*  Recognized 5 different hand gestures from short video clips
*  Developed a generator to process videos as sequences of images
*  Created Conv3D models with varying numbers of layers and evaluated their accuracy
*  Built Conv2D models with TimeDistributed layers, as well as GRU and LSTM models, and assessed their accuracy and performance

### Melanoma Detection using custom convolutional neural network using TensorFlow
*  Rescaled and normalized images to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for predicting 9 classes of skin cancer
*  Trained the model over a specified number of epochs
*  Selected a data augmentation strategy and an optimizer, addressing class imbalance

### Predict Telecom customer churn by selecting best model 
*   Explored the data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, including feature engineering and variable transformation
*   Determined appropriate models to use
*   Selected training mechanisms such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
*   Built models using regression techniques like Logistic Regression with XGBoost
*   Developed models using Random Forest and advanced regression techniques
*   Evaluated and selected the best-performing model

### House Price Prediction using Advanced Regression Techniques
*   Predicted House Prices for a Housing Company using Ridge and Lasso regression methods
*   Compared Ridge and Lasso regression methods and understand factors driving the house prices 

### Predict Bike Rental counts using Linear Regression for a Bike Rental company
*  	Cleaned and understood data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques   
*   Prepared the data before building the model
*   Built and evaluated Linear Regression Model 

### Exploratory Data Analysis with Lending Club Case study  
*   Analysed loan data for a financial institution using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques.
*   Identified customer attributes and factors contributing to financial loss for the company.
*   Utilized Python libraries including NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn

# Projects

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
